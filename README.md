Comparing frontend frameworks

* `Remix`
* `Next.js` with the app router
* `Next.js` with the pages router

## Setup
This Repo is set up as a yarn workspace, so all you need to do is a `yarn install` at the root to set up all the workspaces. Once you've done that, run `yarn db:generate` to generate the Prisma database.

## Remix
Run `yarn remix:dev`

## Next with the App Router
Run `yarn next-app:dev`

## Next with the Pages Router
Run `yarn next-pages:dev`
